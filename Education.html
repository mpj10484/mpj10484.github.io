			<LI style="font-size:17px"><b>Walnut Grove Elementary School</b>- I went to elementary school 
			at Walnut Grove from Kindergarten to 5th Grade. Even from an early age, my leadership skills 
			were already showing as I made straight A's and was class president.</li>
			<LI style="font-size:17px"><b>Creekland Middle School</B>- I attended Creekland all through 
			middle school. While there, I served as a peer leader and president of Beta Club.</li>
			<LI style="font-size:17px"><b>Collins Hill High School</b>- In high school, I was definitely 
			very busy. I was an executive board member for Relay for Life, captain for both the Water Polo 
			and Swim Teams, a peer leader, a member of the National Honor Society, and took 11 AP courses. 
			One of my greatest achievements was my senior year when I was named second place in Gwinnett 
			County for Peer Leader of the year and recieved a $500 scholarship. I won this award based on 
			a video I submitted detailing my experience as a peer leader and what I learned.</li>
