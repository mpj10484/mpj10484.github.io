	<H3>Family Life</h3>
	<P class="margin">I was born on September 9th, 1997 in Smyrna, Georgia and lived there as the only child 
	until my parents and I moved to Suwanee, Georgia in 2003. Being the oldest of three siblings, 
	I have always had an enormous amount of responsibility. I am five years older than my little 
	sister, Anna Kate, and eight years older than my little brother, Jack. These large age 
	differences resulted in me never really having an interest in playing with my siblings even
	though they were best friends. I sometimes felt rather lonely because of our age differences,
	but I also learned how to be independent and a strong leader at a young age. Throughout my 
	life, I have always had to tutor, advise, and care for my siblings. I have done countless 
	science fair projects, driven to many softball and basketball practices, and confronted anyone 
	who I suspect may bully them. I spent the past fourteen years of my life to be the big brother 
	and leader that I want in my life and will continue to do so for the rest of their lives. My 
	siblings have helped me exercise my leadership skills their whole lives, which has helped me 
	with many aspects in my life.</P>
	<h3>Sports</h3>
		<ul class="Overlap">
			<li style="font-size:18px"><img src="Polo.jpg" alt="Polo" style="float:right"><b>Water Polo</b>- I started playing water polo in 8th grade 
			and continued until my freshman year at UGA when I played for the UGA Club Water Polo 
			team. My position was goalie.</li>
			<li style="font-size:18px"><b>Swimming</b>- I have been swimming ever since I can 
			remember. I don't swim competitively anymore now but my favorite event is the 50 and 
			100 free because I enjoy sprinting.</li>
			<li style="font-size:18px"><b>Tennis</b>- I spent most of my summers growing up on the 
			tennis courts. I played competitively on and off throughout my childhood but now I just play 
			with my friends in my free time.</li>

	<h3><img src="Capital.jpg" alt="Capital" style="float:left">A Passion for Politics</h3>
		<p style="font-size:20px" class="Overlap">Ever since I was 11 years old, I have been very passionate about our 
		political climate and America in general. Just recently I traveled to Washington DC to attend 
		the annual AIPAC Policy Conference where I had the opportunity to lobby with congressmen and 
		women, have a personal tour of the capital after hours, sit on the house floor, and hear from 
		incredible speakers such as Nancy Pelosi, Mike Pence, and Nikki Hayley. I am currently an 
		executive board member of the UGA College Republicans and hope to pursue a career in government 
		later in life.</p>
